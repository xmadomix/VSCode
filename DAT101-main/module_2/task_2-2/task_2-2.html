        <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
        <p>
          [ when using constants, you can use it for putting in values, as these wont change throughout the program.
          when using variables, you use these when you want the value to change during the programming, as its easier to make changes.
          constants are fixed, which means whenever you program, you need variables to store values that change, in short:
          constants -> fixed values
          variables -> dynamic values ]

        <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
        <p>
          [using parentheses affects the arithmetic outcome by changing the order of operations. these parentheses tells the computer / you what to do inside the parentheses first before the other commands.
          when coding as an example, without the parentheses, multiplication happens first. but adding parentheses (first part where the addition is) that part happens first.
          basically, they help ho the calculations are done

          example:
          3 + 2 * 5 = 13
          (3 + 2) * 5 = 25

          the part where the parentheses were put is solved first before anything else. ]
        </p>
        <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
        <p>
          [ to limit floating-point numbers, you are able to round them. this makes it easier to read but makes the resulting number look more clean and in a way whole. 
          in many languages, including javascript you can use the function round() 
          you have a number (56.132564) but want to round it:
          
          number = 56.132564
          rounded_number = round(number, 2)
          this ensures the number is displayed or used with specified precision, this function rounds to 2 decimal places. ]
        </p>
        <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
        <p>
          [ to compare the two floating-point values, you have to check the difference between them is very small instead of checking for exact equality. 
          the values 12.199999 and 12.2, seems familiar but we can check if the distance is small to compare them: 
          
          abs(a - b) < 0.00001
          (checks if the difference is tiny) 
          
          checking the values like this make you account for minor rounding differences hen comparing floating-point numbers. ]
        </p>
        <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
        <p>
          [ we have comparison operators ( ==, !=, >, <) returns true or false based on whether the comparison is correct.
          5 > 3 # returns true
          5 == 3 # returns false
          
          the >< signs shows which value is bigger while == shows that the values are of equal value.
          
          you can use these directly aswell in conditions, ith statements (if, else) to check if they are true or false:
          
          if 5 > 3: 
          print("true") 
          
          this will run because 5 > 3 is true. ]
        </p>
        <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
        <p>
          [ this function (math.random()) generates a random decimal number between 0 and 1 (0 being inclusive and 1 exclusive) 
          you can use math.random for such things like:
          generating random numbers, an example is like random dice rolls
          and you can simulate randomness in games or programs
          
          example:
          
          let randomNum = Math.random();
          
          to get a random number in a specific range, you can scale it
          
          let randomNum, = Math.random(); * 10 + 1;
          (with the exapmle range from 1 to 10, you can get a random number from this function. ) ]
        </p>
        <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
        <p>
          [ Modulus is an operator that gives the remainder of a division. 

          an example:
          console.log(10 % 3) ;

          (remainder that this works for other languages as well, including python)
          whenever you use modulus operator, it checks divisibility, an example is if num % 2 == 0 checks if a number is even.
          and it can cycle thru ranges, like wrapping around in a circular list or limiting values, an example is how the clock works, how the time moves]
